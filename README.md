# vtenext-blueberry
a fresh new User Interface perspective for [VTENEXT](https://www.vtenext.com/en/)

<h1>What is it?</h1>
a new user interface theme for VTENEXT, designed to replace the default theme <code>next</code> .

a theme in VTENEXT is a complete front end user interface design, and it covers all aspects of the front end design and user interactions with the application.
separating the front end user interface from the backend is a good practice.

the theme is the default theme for [MavenCRM](https://github.com/mavenea/MavenCRM) , a fork of VTENEXT.
